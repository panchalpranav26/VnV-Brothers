## ⚙️ Local Development & Deployment

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
npm install
2. Run Locally
bash
Copy code
netlify dev
Serves pages at http://localhost:8888

Functions available at /api/save-form and /api/get-submissions

3. Deploy to Netlify
bash
Copy code
netlify deploy --prod
Or upload the zipped project via Netlify Drop.

🧩 Netlify Function: Form Submission
How It Works
/assets/js/pages/contact_consult.js posts form data via
fetch("/api/save-form")

The function save-form.ts validates input and stores the record in:

/tmp/submissions.txt (simple, temporary), or

Netlify Blobs (persistent storage)

Optionally sends an email notification through Resend API.

Optional Environment Variables
Set these in Netlify → Site Settings → Environment Variables if using email notifications:

Key	Description
RESEND_API_KEY	Resend API key
NOTIFY_TO	Recipient email address
NOTIFY_FROM	From address (e.g. no-reply@vnvbrothers.com)

🚀 Final Deployment Notes
All internal links use root-relative paths (/pages/...).

Serverless functions run only on a deployed Netlify environment (not via file://).

Redirects in netlify.toml map /api/* → /.netlify/functions/*.

CORS and security headers are already configured.
