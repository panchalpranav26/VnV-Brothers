## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development & Deployment

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
npm install
2. Run Locally
bash
Copy code
netlify dev
Serves pages at http://localhost:8888

Functions available at /api/save-form and /api/get-submissions

3. Deploy to Netlify
bash
Copy code
netlify deploy --prod
Or upload the zipped project via Netlify Drop.

üß© Netlify Function: Form Submission
How It Works
/assets/js/pages/contact_consult.js posts form data via
fetch("/api/save-form")

The function save-form.ts validates input and stores the record in:

/tmp/submissions.txt (simple, temporary), or

Netlify Blobs (persistent storage)

Optionally sends an email notification through Resend API.

Optional Environment Variables
Set these in Netlify ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables if using email notifications:

Key	Description
RESEND_API_KEY	Resend API key
NOTIFY_TO	Recipient email address
NOTIFY_FROM	From address (e.g. no-reply@vnvbrothers.com)

üöÄ Final Deployment Notes
All internal links use root-relative paths (/pages/...).

Serverless functions run only on a deployed Netlify environment (not via file://).

Redirects in netlify.toml map /api/* ‚Üí /.netlify/functions/*.

CORS and security headers are already configured.
