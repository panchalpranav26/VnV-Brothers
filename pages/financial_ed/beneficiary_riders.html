    <h2>Beneficiaries: Choosing Who You Protect</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>beneficiary</strong> is the person or entity that receives your life insurance proceeds.
      It’s a key decision — one that defines your legacy and ensures your loved ones are supported when they need it most.

    <table class="flashy-table">
      <thead><tr><th>Beneficiary Type</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr><td><strong>Primary Beneficiary</strong></td><td>The first person or organization to receive policy proceeds upon your passing.</td><td>Your spouse, child, or trust.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Contingent Beneficiary</strong></td><td>Receives benefits only if the primary beneficiary has passed away or cannot claim them.</td><td>Your sibling, parent, or charity.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Revocable</strong></td><td>You can change this beneficiary anytime during the policy’s life.</td><td>Updating your child’s name after marriage or adoption.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Irrevocable</strong></td><td>Once named, this beneficiary cannot be changed without their written consent.</td><td>Often used in divorce settlements or business agreements.</td></tr>

    <h2>Riders: Tailoring Protection to Your Life</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Riders</strong> are add-ons to your life insurance policy that extend or customize coverage.
      They offer flexibility for changing needs, such as income replacement, disability, or child coverage.
