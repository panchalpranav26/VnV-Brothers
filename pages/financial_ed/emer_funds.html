        <h2>What Is an Emergency Fund?</h2>
        <p>
            An <strong>emergency fund</strong> is money set aside for unplanned expenses — like medical bills, job loss, or urgent home repairs.
            It helps you avoid high-interest debt when emergencies happen.

    <!-- Why It Matters -->
    <section class="flashy-section reveal delay-1">
        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Without an emergency fund, even small setbacks can create major financial stress. Having 3–6 months of living expenses saved
            offers peace of mind and flexibility during tough times.

            <h3>How Much to Save</h3>
            <p>
                Start with a goal of <strong>$1,000</strong> for immediate emergencies. Then grow it to cover
                <strong>3–6 months</strong> of your basic expenses — rent, food, transportation, and insurance.
            </p>

        <div class="flashy-card">
            <h3>Where to Keep It</h3>
            <p>
                Use a <strong>high-yield savings account</strong> that’s separate from your checking. It should be easily accessible
                but not so convenient that you’ll dip into it for non-emergencies.
            </p>

                <li>Automate a transfer every payday.</li>
                <li>Direct tax refunds or bonuses into savings.</li>
                <li>Cut small, non-essential expenses temporarily.</li>

            Even a small start builds momentum. Commit to saving a set amount each month, no matter how small — consistency beats perfection.
            Over time, your emergency fund becomes the foundation for financial freedom.
