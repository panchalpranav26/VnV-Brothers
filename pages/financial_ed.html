    <section style="margin-top: 40px;">
        <h2>Budgeting Basics</h2>
        <p>A budget is your financial roadmap. It helps you track where your money comes from and where it goes, ensuring you live within your means and allocate funds toward your goals. We recommend the 50/30/20 rule: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and debt repayment.</p>

        <h2>Emergency Funds: Your Financial Safety Net</h2>
        <p>An emergency fund is a readily accessible pool of money set aside for unexpected expenses, such as medical bills or job loss. Aim to save three to six months' worth of living expenses in a separate, high-yield savings account. This fund prevents you from going into debt when life throws a curveball.</p>

    <section style="margin-top: 40px;">
        <h2>Effective Debt Management</h2>
        <p>Not all debt is created equal. High-interest debt, like credit cards, should be prioritized. Strategies like the debt snowball (paying off smallest debts first) or debt avalanche (paying off highest-interest debts first) can provide a structured path to becoming debt-free. The key is consistency and avoiding new high-interest debt.</p>
